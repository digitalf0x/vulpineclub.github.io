## 2018-11-08 16:55:00 -0500

- 16:55 - deployed prod-20181108-01 (6bdfc5f759ab)

- 17:00 - reverted to prod-20181105-01 (8ed6832fba82); URL was mis-specified in the configuration.  doing a rebuild with a hotfix'd Dockerfile.

- 17:25 - re-deploying prod-20181108-01 (a247d59d6d7d)

- 17:30 - okay this looks good.  resolving!

- 19:20 - observed that avatars and headers are not loading on public pages, because /avatars and /headers are not set up on the CloudFront side.  fixing this, should be about 10 minutes

## 2018-11-08 19:30:00 -0500

- 19:30 - re-opening outage because of reports of multiple folks getting greyscreen on the web UI

- 19:38 - `<rey> oh the fucking “What’s New” tab was hiding the console in chrome`

- 19:40 - determined that the problem was CORS

- 19:55 - brief full-system outage (all containers) because of unclear documentation on a Docker command-line argument

- 20:15 - rollback build started... the image without `CDN_HOST` had been expired so it had to be rebuilt

- 20:30 - workaround in place to force things to work; cache invalidations begins

- 21:00 - CloudFront reconfigured to properly handle `OPTIONS` requests, the `Origin` header, and the `__uncache` invalidation parameter. props to @bea@glitch.social for the tips.

- 21:10 - things seem okay now

- 21:12 - a brief glimpse into our ops backchannel...
  - `<rey> wait did i not deploy the rollback build`
  - `<rey> oh my god why am i doing this while high`
  - `<tastymochafox> cuz who isnt high in 2018`
  - `<rey> a point of valid`

- 21:40 - deployed a rebuilt `prod-20181108-02` image to force an invalidation

- 21:45 - looks better.  i am monitoring.
